# wavefunction_development_in_fanpy
These codes define the overlaps corresponding to a specific wavefunction in the mathematical framwork of Flexible-Ansatz for N-body Configuration Interaction (FANCI). https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210271X21000463

For the implementation these codes need to be pasted in the wfn folder in fanpy repository. 

#contents
1. old hierarchy CI (based on Loos et.al model)
2. new hierarchy CI (proposed by our research group)
